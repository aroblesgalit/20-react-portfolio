                    <p>
                        I was tasked to design the LGBTQ Center OC's (a gay and lesbian
                        non-profit organization) logo for their annual Indigo Ball black-tie
                        fundraiser event. The logo was to be classy and clever that would
                        work well on print and on the website.
