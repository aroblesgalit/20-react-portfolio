            Front-End Web Developer with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Graphic Design from California State 
            Polytechnic University, Pomona and a Certificate of Completion of the Coding Bootcamp 
            Certifcate Program from the University of Texas at Austin. Skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, 
            Mongodb, Express, React, and Node.js. Strengths in balancing design and functionality, 
            collaboration, and time-management. Time in the coding bootcamp, allowed for completion of 
            projects, such as a full-stack application for teachers to effortlessly create and share 
            multiple-choice and timed quizzes as well as for students to conveniently take them on their 
            mobile. Applied aspects of UX/UI and agile development while working in a team of five. 
            Enrolling in the bootcamp helped me realize how much I enjoy coding and seeing my designs 
            come to life. I look forward to leveraging the skills Iâ€™ve learned to provide the best solutions.
