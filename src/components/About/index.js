                Front-End Web Developer with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Graphic Design from Cal Poly Pomona and a
                Certificate in Full Stack Web Development from UT Austin. Skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Mongodb,
                Express, React, and Node.js. Strengths in balancing design and functionality, collaboration, and
                time-management. During my time in the coding bootcamp, I’ve completed projects, such as a Full Stack
                app that allows aspiring individuals, hoping to get into certain fields, find resources to help them
                get started. I was able to apply aspects of UX/UI and agile development while working in a team of
                4-5. Enrolling in the bootcamp made me realize how much I enjoy coding and seeing my designs come to
                life. I look forward to leveraging the skills I’ve learned to provide the best solutions.
